Web Design:
Hi, I am Chandrima from India.
I have started my web designing journey 3 years age. I am basically from Computer Science background but honestly speaking I didn't learn any web development specific skills there. So after my 3 years of diploma I have chosen this course to learn a lot more specifically in Web designing field. 
I want to design and develop professional looking website and want to see myself as a web designer in upcoming years. 

Thank you so much.
